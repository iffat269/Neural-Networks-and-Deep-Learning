# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
This repository offers a repertoireÂ of rudimentary neural networks and deeplearning implementations developed with Python. It is intended for people who seek to study the basics of neural networks and deeplearning.
Exhibited projects offer basic codes to define the neural network structure, initialize_parameters, forward_propagation, compute_cost, implement backpropagation, update parameters, integrate and build neural network models, and finally test with predict and use planner database to evaluate. Additionally, tune the hidden layer to observe different behaviour.

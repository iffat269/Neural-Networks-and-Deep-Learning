# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
This repository offers a repertoireÂ of rudimentary neural networks and deeplearning implementations developed with Python. It is intended for people who seek to study the basics of neural networks and deeplearning.
Exhibited projects offer basic codes to define the neural network structure, initialize_parameters, forward_propagation, compute_cost, implement backpropagation, update parameters, integrate and build neural network models, and finally test with predict and use planner database to evaluate. Additionally, tune the hidden layer to observe different behaviour.

**Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer**
This project demonstrates basic neural network and deep learning implementations in Python. It covers defining the neural network structure, initializing parameters, forward propagation, cost computation, backpropagation, parameter updates, and integrating these to build and test models. Additionally, it enables hidden layer tuning to analyze different behaviors and uses a planner database for evaluation. This serves as an excellent starting point for understanding fundamental neural network concepts.
